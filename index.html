        <p>Hello! My name is Vivian Eze. I am from Lagos, Nigeria. I am studying Web Fundamentals and learning how
            to
            build websites.</p>
        <p>I am a mother, student, and aspiring web developer with a passion for helping people—especially youth and
            underprivileged children. With experience in IT support and ongoing training in web development, I enjoy
            solutions that make life easier and create real opportunities for others.</p>
        <p>I’m currently taking a web development course that has strengthened my skills in building websites and
            understanding how technology can solve real-life problems. Alongside my studies, I am working on a digital platform for
            youth agripreneurs and building my own fruit-based beverage brand, Wberry.</p>
        <p>Balancing school, family, and community projects isn’t always easy, but it fuels my growth and inspires
            me to keep learning and making a positive difference.</p>
